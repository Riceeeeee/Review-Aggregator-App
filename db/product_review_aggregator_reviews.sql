Also being someone who has a cat I\'m a little afraid that if the cat were to brush up against the monitor it could fall off the loosely secured mount.\n\nSo overall I\'d say if you need a new monitor but cant afford to pay for a primum one, despite the low price I find this monitor to be of surprisingly good quality and reasonable value for the low cost.','2025-07-13 00:00:00','2025-11-19 07:01:32',0,'approved',1),(117,'2','walmart_api','walmart-b967c4f24db28c6e','nathan',5,'Really great monitor','love this monitor.

Sin embargo, esperaba más fps con un 5060, pero supongo que debería haber investigado de antemano. Pero dependiendo del juego, obtengo entre 180-240 fps en promedio. Así que si usted está buscando una PC confiable para los juegos y no tiene dinero para una PC de gama muy alta, entonces recomiendo esta. Ahora para las malas críticas no sobre el artículo, sino sobre los empleados de Walmart. Los empleados son muy descuidados con el equipo y los artículos. Alguien estaba recibiendo un artículo aparcado a mi lado y una de las obras golpeó mi coche con el ascensor. Abrí la puerta para comprobarlo y me dijo “tu coche está bien” de una manera muy grosera. Después de que él regresó, lo comprobé de todos modos y afortunadamente no había nada malo con mi auto. Y entonces llegó el momento de que me entregaran el artículo, le dije al trabajador que lo pusiera en mi maletero. Mientras lo recogía, por alguna razón solo cogió 1 mango al principio, lo que le hizo dejar caer la computadora al suelo. Se disculpó mucho, pero aún así. ¿Por qué no levantarlo con ambas manos al menos? La computadora todavía funciona bien, pero si pide algo para la recolección, sea muy cauteloso.','2025-09-02 00:00:00','2025-11-19 17:26:48',0,'approved',0),(150,'7','walmart_api','walmart-439d1bb28ab62e04','Greg',4,'Es agradable, pero tiene algunos defectos','He tenido este PC hace casi una semana. Inmediatamente después de salir de la caja noté una imperfección en la puerta de cristal en el borde de la misma. Estoy tentado a cambiarlo por eso. También descubrí que el botón \"LED\" en la caja en realidad restablece la computadora porque la placa base ASUS no tiene un conector para un botón LED. Por último, no he tenido mucho tiempo y el ventilador de la CPU está empezando a quejarse un poco. Es débil, pero quién sabe cuándo empeorará y necesitará ser reemplazado. De lo contrario, me gusta. Es rápido, funciona muy bien con Linux, se ve decente, tiene suficiente memoria por ahora, tiene partes de marca (aunque no he comprobado la fuente de alimentación), y puedo reemplazarla más adelante si es necesario.','2025-11-14 00:00:00','2025-11-19 17:26:48',0,'approved',0),(151,'7','walmart_api','walmart-ad9850e903430a16','anonymous',2,'Problemas con el controlador de gráficos y pantallas negras.','Estaba funcionando bien entonces de repente pantalla en negro después de pantalla en negro sin final a la vista.
